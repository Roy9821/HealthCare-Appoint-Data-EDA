## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on healthcare appointment data. In this project, we aim to gain insights, identify trends, and understand the patterns in healthcare appointment data to inform healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers.

## Data Source

## Analysis Goals

Our primary goals for this EDA project include:

- Understanding the distribution of appointment dates and times.
- Analyzing patient demographics, such as age, gender, and location.
- Investigating the relationship between appointment outcomes and various factors.
- Identifying any trends or patterns in appointment scheduling and attendance.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the raw healthcare appointment data files.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and visualization.
- `scripts/`: This directory contains any relevant Python scripts used in data processing.
- `results/`: This directory holds the results of the EDA, including visualizations and findings.
- `LICENSE`: This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## Installation
